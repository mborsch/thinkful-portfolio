        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <article class="about-section">

            <div class="about-left">I graduated From the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign in 2016.
                From there I went on to work as an exercise specialist and fitness coordinator.
                While I enjoyed my work, I felt a longing to work in software development.
            </div>
            <div class="about-center">
                I decided that there's no time like the present, and enrolled in Thinkful's Software Engineering
                program.
                I love the program and I love getting the chance to learn languages and apply them in fun and unique
                ways.
            </div>
            <div class="about-right">
                If you are looking for someone to create a website for you, or if you are looking to collaborate on a
                project, feel free to get in touch!
                I'm always learning and growing, and would enjoy any opportunity to collaborate.
