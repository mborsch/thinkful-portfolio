        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <article class="about-section">

            <div class="about-left">I graduated From the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign in 2016.
                From there I went on to work as an exercise specialist and fitness coordinator.
                While I enjoyed my work, I felt a longing to work in software development.
            </div>
            <div class="about-center">
               Outside of my professional life, I have a dog named Xanthe who is my world. 
                I spoil her with trips to the beach, delicious treats, and dog park shenanigans.
                She is sassy and sweet and a great companion.
            </div>
            <div class="about-right">
                My personal hobbies include hiking, snowboarding, camping, traveling, and watching film.
                It is my dream to live near a mountain so I can enjoy the outdoors more.
                I also love podcasts and am always looking for a new one to dive into.
